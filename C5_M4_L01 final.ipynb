    "## Scenario\n",
    "You're a new intern at a company that develops educational software. You've been assigned to a team that's working on a trivia game application. The team recently acquired a code library from another developer that contains the core quiz functionality. However, this code library is poorly documented, making it difficult to understand and integrate into the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will not only test your Python skills but also your ability to make sense of undocumented code and create clear, helpful documentation. By documenting this quiz program, you'll enable your team to integrate it into the trivia game application more effectively, contributing to a successful product launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Your task is to examine this code library and create comprehensive documentation. You'll need to:\n",
    "* Understand the quiz program's structure: Determine how the code handles questions, answers, scoring, and user interaction.\n",
    "* Create clear and concise documentation: Write docstrings that explain the purpose of each function and class, including their parameters, return values, and any potential errors.\n",
    "* Improve the code's readability: Refactor variable names, add comments, and restructure code to make it easier to understand.\n",
    "* Generate examples and use cases: Provide illustrative examples of how to use the quiz program and its various features."
